# pH-Clostridium-acetobutylicum
Python code for the in sillico analysis of the work: "pH-Driven Shifts in Acetic, Butyric, and Lactic Acid Production: Implications for ATP Synthesis, Redox Balance and Biohydrogen Generation in a Degenerated  Strain of Clostridium acetobutylicum"

The pheflux model (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36915687/) was used to compute fluxes.
